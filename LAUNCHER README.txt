   - Beautiful ASCII art interface
   - Detailed error checking and troubleshooting
   - Better user experience with colored output

3. "Launch Game.ps1" - PowerShell launcher
   - For users who prefer PowerShell
   - Similar functionality to the batch files
   - May require PowerShell execution policy changes

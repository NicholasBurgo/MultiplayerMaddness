-- Placeholder Steam API files
-- These files will be replaced with actual Steam libraries when available

-- This is a placeholder for steam_api.dll
-- In a real implementation, you would download steam_api.dll from Steamworks SDK
-- and place it in the libs/ directory

-- This is a placeholder for luasteam.dll
-- In a real implementation, you would compile luasteam library
-- and place luasteam.dll in the libs/ directory

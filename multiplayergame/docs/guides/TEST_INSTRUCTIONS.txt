MULTIPLAYER MADNESS - TESTING GUIDE
========================================

After the refactoring, here's how to test the game:

QUICK START
-----------
1. Navigate to multiplayergame folder
2. Run: love . (or use your LOVE launcher)
3. Menu should appear

BASIC TESTS
-----------

Test 1: Menu Display
✓ Menu shows "MULTIPLAYER MADNESS"
✓ Shows instructions: H to host, J to join, ESC to quit
✓ No errors in console

Test 2: Host Game
✓ Press H key
✓ Console shows: "[info][app] Host intent received"
✓ Console shows: "[info][net.lan] Server started successfully"  
✓ Screen switches to LOBBY
✓ Shows "Players: 1"
✓ Shows "Press M to start match"

Test 3: Join Game (requires 2 game instances)
✓ Launch game in first window, press H to host
✓ Launch game in second window, press J to join
✓ Second window connects to first
✓ Console shows: "[info][app] Connected to server"
✓ Second window switches to LOBBY
✓ First window shows "Players: 2"

Test 4: PING/PONG Exchange
✓ Join game as client (test 3)
✓ Watch console output
✓ Should see: "[info][app] Received PING from server"
✓ Should see: "[info][app] Received PONG from ..."

Test 5: Start Match
✓ Host game (press H)
✓ Press M key
✓ Screen switches to MATCH scene
✓ Countdown appears: "Starting in: 3.0"
✓ Countdown decreases: 2.9, 2.8, ... 0.1
✓ Shows "GO!" when countdown complete

Test 6: Disconnect
✓ Join game from client
✓ Close host window
✓ Client should see: "[info][app] Disconnected from server"
✓ Client returns to MENU

EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT
-----------------------

Host:
[info][app] Initializing application
[info][app] Switching to scene: menu
[info][app] Host intent received
[info][net.lan] Starting server...
[info][net.lan] Trying port 12345
[info][net.lan] Successfully started on port 12345
[info][app] Switching to scene: lobby

Client:
[info][app] Initializing application  
[info][app] Switching to scene: menu
[info][app] Join intent received
[info][net.lan] Starting client...
[info][net.lan] Connecting to 127.0.0.1:12345
[info][net.lan] Connection attempt sent
[info][net.lan] Connected to server
[info][app] Connected to server
[info][app] Switching to scene: lobby

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
- Mini-games (jump, laser, etc.) not yet integrated with new scene system
- Player customization not accessible from new lobby
- Music handler not integrated
- Debug console not visible in new UI

These are expected - the old mini-games are preserved but need 
additional integration work to connect with the new architecture.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Problem: "Cannot find module 'src.core.app'"
Solution: Make sure you're running from multiplayergame/ folder

Problem: Port 12345 already in use
Solution: Close other game instances, or LAN will try ports 12346-12348

Problem: Can't connect to host
Solution: Check firewall, make sure host started successfully first

Problem: No console output
Solution: Run from command line to see output, or check Windows Terminal

TRANSPORT SWITCHING
-------------------

To switch from LAN to Steam (when Steam is implemented):

Edit multiplayergame/main.lua line 12:
FROM: local transport = require("src.net.lan")
TO:   local transport = require("src.net.steam")

That's it! No other changes needed.

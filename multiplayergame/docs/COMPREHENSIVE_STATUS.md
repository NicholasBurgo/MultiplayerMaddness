   - Implement vote broadcasting from clients to host
   - Implement vote updates from host to all clients
   - Add party mode vote handling

2. **Player Position Sync**
   - Send position updates to server when player moves
   - Broadcast position updates to all clients
   - Implement smooth interpolation for remote players

3. **Game Launch Flow**
   - Complete host → clients game launch message
   - Ensure all clients transition to game scene together
   - Handle game end and return to lobby

4. **Party Mode Implementation**
   - Add party mode random game selection
   - Implement random game rotation
   - Track scores across multiple games

5. **Play/Play Now Logic**

### Medium Priority
6. **Legacy Game Integration**
   - Integrate duelgame.lua
   - Integrate racegame.lua
   - Integrate speedrunner.lua

### Low Priority
7. **Settings Menu**
   - Implement volume controls
   - Add graphics options
   - Add keybinding customization

8. **Steam Integration**
   - Implement Steam transport layer
   - Add Steam lobby support
   - Integrate achievements

## 📊 Code Metrics

# Bug Fixes and Corrections

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Character Customization Moved to Menu** âœ…
**Problem**: Character customization was in lobby (wrong location)  
**Fix**: Moved to main menu where it belongs

**Changes:**
- Menu "Customize" button now opens character customization scene
- New `customization.lua` scene created
- Integrates with existing `charactercustom.lua` module
- Saves to `savefile.lua` on completion
- Returns to menu after customization

**How to Use:**
```
Menu â†’ Click "Customize" â†’ Draw face, choose color â†’ Done/Cancel â†’ Returns to menu
```

### 2. **SPACE Key Now Opens Voting** âœ…
**Problem**: TAB was opening voting, but original used SPACE  
**Fix**: Changed to match original behavior

**New Controls:**
```
Lobby:
  WASD    - Move character
  SPACE   - Open/close level selector (voting menu)
  ESC     - Leave lobby

Level Selector (when open):
  WASD    - Navigate between games
  V       - Vote for selected game
  ENTER   - Launch game (host only)
  SPACE   - Close selector
  ESC     - Close selector
```

### 3. **Fixed player.color Nil Error** âœ…
**Problem**: `attempt to index field 'color' (a nil value)`  
**Fix**: Multiple safeguards added

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Safety check in drawVotingPanel:
```lua
for id, player in pairs(players) do
    if player and player.name and player.color then  -- Added color check
        -- Draw player info
    end
end
```

#### B. Player initialization with defaults:
```lua
-- In lobby.load()
for id, player in pairs(players) do
    if not player.color then
        local colors = {{1,0,0}, {0,1,0}, {0,0,1}, {1,1,0}, {1,0,1}, {0,1,1}}
        player.color = colors[(id % #colors) + 1]
    end
end
```

#### C. Load saved data for host:
```lua
-- In app.lua intent:host
local savefile = require("scripts.savefile")
local savedData = savefile.loadPlayerData()

app.players = {
    [0] = {
        id=0,
        name=savedData.name or "Host",
        color=savedData.color or {1, 0, 0},  -- Always has color
        facePoints=savedData.facePoints,
        x=100,
        y=100,
        totalScore=0
    }
}
```

---

### 4. **Added Missing Input Handlers** âœ…
**Problem**: Character customization needs text input and key release  
**Fix**: Added handlers throughout the stack

**Added to main.lua:**
```lua
function love.keyreleased(k)
    if app.keyreleased then app.keyreleased(k) end
end

function love.textinput(t)
    if app.textinput then app.textinput(t) end
end
```

**Added to app.lua:**
```lua
function app.keyreleased(k)
    if app.active and app.active.keyreleased then
        app.active.keyreleased(k)
    end
end

function app.textinput(t)
    if app.active and app.active.textinput then
        app.active.textinput(t)
    end
end
```

**Implemented in customization.lua:**
```lua
function customization.textinput(t)
    characterCustomization.textinput(t)
end

function customization.keyreleased(k)
    if characterCustomization.keyreleased then
        characterCustomization.keyreleased(k)
    end
end
```

2. **Event System** - Uses pub/sub instead of globals
3. **Transport Layer** - Networking abstracted
4. **Scene Management** - Clean scene transitions

### Preserved Exactly:
1. **All visual elements** - Same UI, same layout
2. **All controls** - Exact same key bindings
3. **All gameplay** - Same voting, movement, customization
4. **All data** - Same save/load system

## Deep Dive: How It All Works

### Flow Diagram:

```
MENU
 â”œâ”€ Click "Play" â†’ Play submenu
 â”‚   â”œâ”€ Click "Host" â†’ Lobby (as host)
 â”‚   â””â”€ Click "Join" â†’ Lobby (as client)
 â”‚
 â”œâ”€ Click "Customize" â†’ Customization Scene
 â”‚   â”œâ”€ Draw face, pick color, set name
 â”‚   â”œâ”€ Click "Done" â†’ Save & return to menu
 â”‚   â””â”€ Click "Cancel" â†’ Return to menu
 â”‚
 â””â”€ Click "Settings" â†’ Settings submenu
     â””â”€ Click "Back" â†’ Menu

LOBBY
 â”œâ”€ WASD â†’ Move character around
 â”‚   â””â”€ Position updates in players table
 â”‚
 â”œâ”€ SPACE â†’ Open Level Selector
 â”‚   â”œâ”€ WASD â†’ Navigate games
 â”‚   â”œâ”€ V â†’ Vote for game
 â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€ Vote counter increases
 â”‚   â”œâ”€ ENTER (host) â†’ Launch game
 â”‚   â””â”€ SPACE/ESC â†’ Close selector
 â”‚
 â””â”€ ESC â†’ Return to menu
```

### Data Flow:

```
1. Character Customization:
   charactercustom.lua (draw face)
   â†’ savefile.lua (save data)
   â†’ customization.lua (scene wrapper)
   â†’ app.lua (scene manager)
   â†’ menu.lua (returns here)

2. Lobby Movement:
   love.keyboard.isDown('w')
   â†’ lobby.update() (move player)
   â†’ players[id].x/y updated
   â†’ lobby.draw() (render player)

3. Voting:
   Press SPACE in lobby
   â†’ levelSelector.active = true
   â†’ lobby.draw() calls drawLevelSelector()
   â†’ Grid displayed
   Press V on game
   â†’ levelSelector.playerVotes[id] = index
   â†’ levelSelector.votes[index] = {players}
   â†’ Vote counter updated
```

---

## Error Prevention

### 1. Nil Color Protection:
```lua
-- Every draw function checks:
if player and player.name and player.color then
    -- Safe to use player.color
end

-- Every player gets default color:
if not player.color then
    player.color = colors[(id % #colors) + 1]
end
```

### 2. Data Initialization:
```lua
-- Host always gets full data:
app.players = {
    [0] = {
        id=0,
        name=savedData.name or "Host",
        color=savedData.color or {1, 0, 0},  -- Always set
        facePoints=savedData.facePoints,
        x=100,
        y=100,
        totalScore=0
    }
}
```

### 3. Save/Load Integration:
```lua
-- Always load from savefile:
local savefile = require("scripts.savefile")
local savedData = savefile.loadPlayerData()

-- Use saved data or defaults:
localPlayer.color = savedData.color or {1, 0, 0}
localPlayer.name = savedData.name or "Player"
```

# 🔧 Praise Game Syntax Error Fix

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Error

```
Syntax error: src/game/scenes/modes/games/praisegame.lua:366: '<eof>' expected near 'end'
```

---

## Root Cause

During the party mode integration, leftover code from a previous edit created an orphaned block with an extra `end` statement.

**Before (Broken):**
```lua
-- Only handle internal timer if not in party mode
if not praiseGame.partyMode then
    praiseGame.timer = praiseGame.timer - dt
    if praiseGame.timer <= 0 then
        praiseGame.timer = 0
        
        -- Start victory scene
        praiseGame.victory_scene = true
    end
end
    praiseGame.scene_timer = praiseGame.scene_duration      -- ❌ Orphaned code!
    
    -- Determine if player is winner
    praiseGame.is_winner = praiseGame.random:random() > 0.5  -- ❌ Orphaned code!
    
    debugConsole.addMessage("[Praise] Timer expired")       -- ❌ Orphaned code!
    return                                                    -- ❌ Orphaned code!
end  -- ❌ EXTRA END with no matching opening!
```

## Solution

Moved the victory scene initialization code **inside** the timer check where it belongs:

**After (Fixed):**
```lua
-- Only handle internal timer if not in party mode
if not praiseGame.partyMode then
    praiseGame.timer = praiseGame.timer - dt
    if praiseGame.timer <= 0 then
        praiseGame.timer = 0
        
        -- Start victory scene (don't set game_over yet - wait for scene to finish)
        praiseGame.victory_scene = true
        praiseGame.scene_timer = praiseGame.scene_duration          -- ✅ Inside block
        
        -- Determine if player is winner (for now, just random for demo)
        praiseGame.is_winner = praiseGame.random:random() > 0.5     -- ✅ Inside block
        
        debugConsole.addMessage("[Praise] Timer expired - starting victory scene")  -- ✅ Inside block
    end
end

-- Update game time
praiseGame.gameTime = praiseGame.gameTime + dt
-- ... rest of game logic continues normally
```

---

## Why This Happened

This was a consequence of the party mode integration where I wrapped the timer logic in:
```lua
if not praiseGame.partyMode then
    -- timer code here
end
```

The victory scene initialization code should have been moved inside the timer expiration check, but it got left outside accidentally, creating orphaned statements and an unmatched `end`.

---

## Result

✅ **Syntax error fixed**  
✅ **Victory scene logic properly scoped**  
✅ **Party mode integration preserved**  
✅ **Game loads without errors**

---

## Files Modified

- `src/game/scenes/modes/games/praisegame.lua` - Fixed orphaned code block

---

1. Launch game ✅
2. Start party mode ✅
3. Play through all games including Praise Game ✅

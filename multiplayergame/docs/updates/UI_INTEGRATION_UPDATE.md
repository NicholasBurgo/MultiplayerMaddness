## 🔧 Technical Details

### Music Handler Integration:
```lua
-- Menu setup
musicHandler.addEffect("menu_bg", "wave", {...})
musicHandler.addEffect("title", "beatPulse", {...})
musicHandler.addEffect("play_button", "beatPulse", {...})

-- In draw():
local bgx, bgy = musicHandler.applyToDrawable("menu_bg", 0, 0)
love.graphics.draw(menuBackground, bgx, bgy)
```

### Button System:
```lua
local function drawButton(button, effectId)
    local x, y, r, sx, sy = musicHandler.applyToDrawable(effectId, x, y)
    -- Draw with transforms...
end
```

### Event Flow:
```
User clicks "Host Game"
  ↓
menu.mousepressed() detects click
  ↓
events.emit("intent:host", {port: 12345})
  ↓
app.lua handles event
  ↓
transport.start("server", opts)
  ↓
setScene("lobby", {isHost: true})
```

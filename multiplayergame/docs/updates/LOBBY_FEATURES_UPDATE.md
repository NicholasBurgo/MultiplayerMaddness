## 📋 Technical Details

### Level Selector System:

```lua
levelSelector = {
    active = false,           -- Is selector open?
    selectedLevel = 1,        -- Currently highlighted
    votes = {},              -- {levelIndex = {playerIds}}
    playerVotes = {},        -- {playerId = levelIndex}
    gridCols = 3,            -- 3 columns
    gridRows = 2,            -- 2 rows
    cardWidth = 200,         -- Card dimensions
    cardHeight = 140,
    cardSpacing = 20
}
```

### Movement System:

```lua
-- In lobby.update(dt):
if not levelSelector.active then
    if love.keyboard.isDown('w') then
        localPlayer.y = localPlayer.y - 200 * dt
    end
    -- ... more movement code
    
    -- Update player in table
    players[localPlayer.id] = {
        x = localPlayer.x,
        y = localPlayer.y,
        -- ... other data
    }
end
```

### Voting System:

```lua
-- When player presses SPACE:
levelSelector.playerVotes[playerId] = levelIndex
levelSelector.votes[levelIndex] = {playerId1, playerId2, ...}

-- Display votes on cards:
local voteCount = #(levelSelector.votes[i] or {})
```

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Events Emitted:
- `intent:start_game` - When host launches a game
- `intent:customize_character` - When C is pressed
- `intent:leave_lobby` - When ESC is pressed
- `vote:cast` - When player votes (TODO: network sync)
- `player:move` - When player moves (TODO: network sync)

### Globals for Compatibility:
```lua
_G.levelSelector = levelSelector  -- For old code
_G.players = players               -- Player list
_G.localPlayer = localPlayer       -- Local player data
```

GAME MODES INTEGRATION - QUICK SUMMARY
========================================

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE

What Was Done:
--------------
✓ Created src/game/scenes/modes/ directory
✓ Created index.lua registry (auto-loads all modes)
✓ Updated app.lua to register modes automatically
✓ Created jump.lua as example modernized module
✓ All 5 game modes now accessible via app.scenes.*

Available Game Modes:
---------------------
- jump          (jumpgame.lua)
- laser         (lasergame.lua)
- meteorshower  (meteorshower.lua)
- dodge         (dodgegame.lua)
- praise        (praisegame.lua)

How It Works:
-------------
1. app.lua loads on startup
2. Reads src/game/scenes/modes/index.lua
3. Index requires all game scripts from scripts/
4. App registers each as a scene
5. Modes accessible as app.scenes.jump, app.scenes.laser, etc.

Console Output on Launch:
-------------------------
[info][app] Initializing application
[info][app] Registered game mode: jump
[info][app] Registered game mode: laser
[info][app] Registered game mode: meteorshower
[info][app] Registered game mode: dodge
[info][app] Registered game mode: praise
[info][app] Switching to scene: menu

Using Game Modes:
-----------------
From lobby, to start a game:
  events.emit("intent:start_match", {mode = "jump"})

From code:
  app.setScene("laser", {players = {...}})

Testing:
--------
1. Launch game → Check console for "Registered game mode" messages
2. All 5 modes should be registered
3. No errors during registration

Benefits:
---------
✅ Zero rewrites required
✅ All existing gameplay preserved
✅ Modular and extensible
✅ Easy to add new modes
✅ Clear separation of concerns
✅ Gradual migration path

File Structure:
---------------
multiplayergame/
  scripts/
    jumpgame.lua          (original files, unchanged)
    lasergame.lua
    meteorshower.lua
    dodgegame.lua
    praisegame.lua
  
  src/
    game/
      scenes/
        modes/
          index.lua       (registry - requires scripts)
          jump.lua        (example modernized version)
    core/
      app.lua             (loads and registers modes)

Next Steps (Optional Future Work):
-----------------------------------
1. Migrate networking to transport layer
2. Replace _G.players with app.players
3. Replace debugConsole with logger
4. Convert timers to timing.lua
5. Add event emissions for state changes
6. Create mode selection UI in lobby

Key Files:
----------
- src/game/scenes/modes/index.lua  (mode registry)
- src/core/app.lua (lines 81-86)   (mode registration)
- GAME_MODES_INTEGRATION.md        (full documentation)

Result:
-------
✅ All game modes successfully integrated
✅ No functionality lost
✅ New modular architecture in place
✅ Ready for gradual migration
✅ Clean separation between old and new systems

Lines of Code:
--------------
- Mode index: 15 lines
- App integration: 5 lines
- Total new code: ~20 lines

To add modules without rewrites!

# Voting System Fix - Matching Original Behavior

## Problem
The voting system wasn't matching the original implementation. It was opening the level selector directly instead of the intermediate game mode selection menu.

## Solution
Restored the **two-step menu flow** from the original `main.lua.backup`:

### Step 1: Game Mode Selection
- Press `SPACE` in lobby → Opens first menu
- Shows options:
  - **Level Selector** - Opens the game grid
  - **Party Mode** - Vote for party mode (random games)
- Navigate with `W/S`, select with `SPACE`, cancel with `ESC`

### Step 2: Level Selector
- Select "Level Selector" from game mode menu → Opens game grid
- Shows 6 games in a 3x2 grid with preview images:
  1. Jump Game
  2. Laser Game
  3. Meteor Shower
  4. Dodge Laser
  5. Praise Game
  6. Coming Soon
- Navigate with `WASD`, vote with `SPACE`, launch with `ENTER` (host only)
- Press `ESC` to return to game mode selection

## Code Changes

### `src/game/scenes/lobby.lua`
1. Added `gameModeSelection` state object (first menu)
2. Added `levelSelector` state object (second menu)
3. Added `drawGameModeSelection()` function
4. Updated `drawLevelSelector()` to match original design
5. Updated `keypressed()` to handle two-step flow

### Key Differences from Before
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| SPACE → Level Selector | SPACE → Game Mode Selection |
| TAB → Open voting menu | N/A (different flow) |
| No intermediate menu | Game Mode Selection as first step |
| V to vote | SPACE to vote (in level selector) |

## Visual Design

Both menus feature:
- Semi-transparent dark overlay
- Animated pulsing borders (green)
- Clear instructions at top and bottom
- Animated selection highlighting
- Music-synced effects

## Voting Status Panel

The voting panel (right side) shows:
- Each player with their color indicator (●)
- What game they voted for
- "No vote" if they haven't voted yet
- Updates in real-time when votes change

## Scripts Organization

Scripts have been properly organized:

### Active (scripts/)
- `anim8.lua`, `charactercustom.lua`, `debugconsole.lua`
- `jumpgame.lua`, `lasergame.lua`, `meteorshower.lua`
- `dodgegame.lua`, `praisegame.lua`
- `musichandler.lua`, `savefile.lua`

### Utilities (src/game/utils/)
- `instructions.lua` - Moved from scripts/ (used by game modes)

### Legacy (scripts/legacy/)
- `duelgame.lua`, `racegame.lua`, `speedrunner.lua`

### Steam (scripts/steam/)
- All Steam integration files (reserved for future use)

## Testing Checklist

## Documentation Updated

- `LOBBY_VOTING_UPDATE.md` - Details on the voting system
- `SCRIPTS_ORGANIZATION.md` - Script categorization
- `COMPREHENSIVE_STATUS.md` - Overall project status
- This file (`VOTING_SYSTEM_FIX.md`)

## Result

✅ **The voting system now perfectly matches the original behavior!**

The two-step menu flow provides better UX by:
1. Giving players clear options before showing the full game list
2. Allowing quick access to party mode voting
3. Making the interface less overwhelming
4. Matching player expectations from the original game

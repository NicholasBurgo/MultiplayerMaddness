# Tab Menu Integration

## Overview
The tab menu functionality has been successfully integrated into the new modular architecture. Players can now press and hold the TAB key to view a ranked list of all players with their current scores.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created:
- `src/game/systems/tabmenu.lua` - New tab menu system module
- `src/core/app.lua` - Integration with global input handling
- All scene files - Added scene names for proper identification

### Key Features:
1. **Global Availability**: Tab menu works in all game scenes except menu and customization
2. **Hold to Show**: Press and hold TAB to show the menu, release to hide
3. **Ranked Display**: Players are sorted by total score (descending) then by name (ascending)
4. **Medal System**: Gold, silver, bronze, and gray colors for top 4 positions
5. **Responsive Design**: Menu scales with screen resolution and centers properly

### Usage:
- Press and hold TAB key during gameplay to show player rankings
- Release TAB key to hide the menu
- Works in lobby, match, and all game modes
- Does not work in main menu or character customization scenes

### Technical Implementation:
- Tab menu state is managed globally in the app module
- Input handling is integrated at the app level to ensure global availability
- Scene names are used to determine where tab menu should be active
- Player data is passed from the app's players table to the tab menu

### Integration with New Architecture:
- Follows the modular design pattern used throughout the refactored codebase
- Uses the same font system and scaling as other UI elements
- Integrates cleanly with the existing event system and scene management
- Maintains compatibility with the new player data structure

## Testing:
To test the tab menu functionality:
1. Start the game and navigate to the lobby
2. Press and hold the TAB key - you should see the player list
3. Release the TAB key - the menu should disappear
4. Test in different game modes to ensure it works everywhere except menus

## Future Enhancements:
- Add more detailed player statistics
- Include game-specific scores (jump score, laser hits, etc.)
- Add player avatars or custom face drawings
- Implement keyboard navigation for accessibility
